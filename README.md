# AzerothCore Module: City Siege

</p>

Overview
--------
The City Siege module for AzerothCore adds dynamic, timed siege events to all major cities in World of Warcraft. On a random, configurable timer, opposing faction forces assault a major city, spawning enemy units outside the city limits who march toward the city leader while engaging defenders. Enemy forces spawn at the city outskirts and use pathfinding and waypoints to march into the city, attacking the faction leader as their primary objective. 

**Both factions can win rewards:** Defenders earn rewards if they protect their city leader until the event ends, while attackers earn rewards if they successfully kill the city leader. This creates competitive PvE content where both Alliance and Horde players have incentive to participate. The module features fully configurable spawn locations, creature entries, reward scaling, and RP elements to create exciting world events that encourage faction participation and creates a more dynamic, living world experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> THIS MODULE IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. IT PROBABLY WONâ€™T WORK, WILL SOMETIMES WORK POORLY, AND MAY RANDOMLY DECIDE TO TAKE A VACATION. DO NOT USE ON AN ACTIVE SERVER OR EXPECT ANYTHING RESEMBLING RELIABILITY UNTIL THIS NOTICE IS GONE.

Features
--------
- **Dynamic Siege Events:**  
  Random timer-based events that bring warfare to major cities with configurable intervals.
- **All Major Cities Supported:**  
  Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar  
  Horde: Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon
- **4-Tier Enemy System:**  
  Regular minions, Elite soldiers, Mini-bosses, and Faction leaders with configurable spawn counts.
- **Strategic Spawning:**  
  Enemies spawn at configurable X/Y/Z locations outside each city (manually positioned at city gates) in tight formation and march toward the city leader.
- **Cinematic RP Phase:**  
  Configurable delay (default 45s) where siege forces stand passive and yell RP messages before combat begins.
- **Periodic Yells:**  
  Leaders and mini-bosses yell threatening messages every 30 seconds during combat for immersion.
- **Configurable Creature Entries:**  
  All 8 creature types (Alliance & Horde variants) fully configurable in .conf file.
- **Flexible Event Timing:**  
  Configurable minimum (120min default) and maximum (240min default) intervals between events.
- **Event Duration Control:**  
  Configurable siege duration (default 30 minutes).
- **Single or Multiple Sieges:**  
  Choose whether only one city can be under siege at a time, or allow multiple simultaneous events.
- **Smart Announcements:**  
  Radius-based or world-wide announcements with color-coded messages.
- **City-Specific Configuration:**  
  Enable or disable events for individual cities.
- **Reward System:**  
  Automatic honor (100 default) and level-scaled gold rewards for winning faction players (base 50 silver + 50 silver per level).
- **Dual Victory Conditions:**  
  Defenders win if the city leader survives, attackers win if they kill the city leader. Both outcomes reward the winning faction.
- **Faction-Based Rewards:**  
  Only players of the winning faction receive rewards - defenders get rewards if they protect their city, attackers get rewards if they conquer it.
- **Automatic Cleanup:**  
  Creatures despawn after event ends, preventing database pollution.
- **Debug Mode:**  
  Comprehensive logging for server administrators.
- **Aggro Configuration:**  
  Separate toggles for player aggro and NPC aggro behavior.

Installation
------------
1. **Clone the Module**  
   Clone the module into your AzerothCore modules directory:
   
       cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
       git clone https://github.com/DustinHendrickson/mod-city-siege.git

2. **Recompile AzerothCore**  
   Rebuild the project with the new module:
   
       cd /path/to/azerothcore
       mkdir build && cd build
       cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/server
       make -j$(nproc)
       make install

3. **Configure the Module**  
   Copy the configuration file to your server's config directory:
   
       cp /path/to/azerothcore/modules/mod-city-siege/conf/mod_city_siege.conf.dist /path/to/server/etc/modules/mod_city_siege.conf

4. **Restart the Server**  
   Launch the world server:
   
       ./worldserver

GM Commands
-----------
Game Masters with `SEC_GAMEMASTER` security level have access to manual siege control commands. These commands allow you to trigger, stop, and manage siege events for testing or special events.

### Available Commands

#### `.citysiege start [cityname]`
Starts a siege event immediately in the specified city or a random enabled city if no name is provided.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege start                  # Start siege in random enabled city
.citysiege start Stormwind        # Start siege in Stormwind
.citysiege start orgrimmar        # Start siege in Orgrimmar (case-insensitive)
```

**Notes:**
- City name matching is case-insensitive
- Validates city exists and is enabled in configuration
- Will not start if a siege is already active in that city
- Respects `CitySiege.AllowMultipleCities` setting

#### `.citysiege stop <cityname> <alliance|horde>`
Stops an active siege event and declares a winner. The GM specifies which faction wins, and players of that faction receive rewards.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege stop Stormwind alliance    # Alliance wins - all Alliance players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind horde       # Horde wins - all Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Orgrimmar horde       # Horde wins - all Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Orgrimmar alliance    # Alliance wins - all Alliance players get rewards
```

**Notes:**
- **Faction parameter is required** - GM manually decides which faction wins the battle
- **Winning faction's players receive rewards** regardless of which city is under siege
- If Alliance wins: Alliance players within range get honor and gold
- If Horde wins: Horde players within range get honor and gold
- Losing faction receives no rewards
- Despawns all siege creatures
- Removes event from active list

#### `.citysiege cleanup [cityname]`
Force despawns all siege creatures and clears event data. Use this if a siege becomes stuck or has issues.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege cleanup                # Cleanup all active sieges
.citysiege cleanup Darnassus      # Cleanup Darnassus siege only
```

**Notes:**
- Force removes creatures **without** reward distribution
- Clears all event data and timers
- Use this for troubleshooting problematic events
- Does not trigger normal end-of-event procedures
- No winner determination or rewards

#### `.citysiege status`
Displays the current status of the City Siege module and all active events.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege status
```

**Output includes:**
- Module enabled/disabled state
- Number of active sieges
- Details for each active siege:
  - City name
  - Time remaining in the event
  - Number of creatures alive
- Time until next automatic siege event

### Command Examples

```
# Test a siege event in Stormwind
.citysiege start Stormwind

# Check how the event is progressing
.citysiege status

# GM observes and decides Alliance wins - Alliance players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind alliance

# Or if GM decides Horde wins - Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind horde

# If creatures get stuck, force cleanup (no rewards, no winner)
.citysiege cleanup Stormwind
```

How It Works
------------
### Event Flow

1. **Timer Phase:**  
   The module waits for a random interval between TimerMin and TimerMax.

2. **City Selection:**  
   A random enabled city is selected for siege. If AllowMultipleCities is disabled and a siege is already active, no new siege will start.

3. **Announcement:**  
   Players in range (or server-wide if AnnounceRadius = 0) are notified with a configurable message (default: color-coded with city name).

4. **Spawn Phase:**  
   Enemy forces spawn at the configured spawn location (set via SpawnX/Y/Z for each city) in tight circular formation:
   - Minions: 30 yards from spawn point (outermost ring)
   - Elites: 21 yards (70% radius from spawn point)
   - Mini-bosses: 15 yards (50% radius from spawn point)
   - Leaders: 10 yards from spawn point (center, leading the formation)

5. **Cinematic Phase:**  
   For the configured delay (default 45 seconds), enemies remain passive and leaders yell RP messages configured in `CitySiege.Yell.LeaderSpawn`.

6. **Combat Phase:**  
   After the cinematic delay, enemies become aggressive and use pathfinding (GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint()) to march toward the city leader. Enemies will engage any hostile players or NPCs in their path based on aggro settings.

7. **Periodic Yells:**  
   Every 30 seconds (configurable), leaders and mini-bosses yell threatening messages configured in `CitySiege.Yell.Combat`.

8. **Event Duration:**  
   The siege lasts for the configured duration (default 30 minutes).

9. **Victory Check:**  
   System verifies if the city leader survived using configured leader positions.

10. **Resolution:**  
    - **If Defenders Win** (city leader survives): Defending faction players receive rewards (Alliance for Alliance cities, Horde for Horde cities)
    - **If Attackers Win** (city leader killed): Attacking faction players receive rewards (Horde conquering Alliance cities, Alliance conquering Horde cities)
    - Creatures despawn and event ends

### Event Mechanics

- **Target Priority:**  
  Siege forces prioritize the city leader but will attack players and NPCs in their path based on aggro configuration.

- **Victory Conditions:**
  - **Defenders Win:** City leader survives the full event duration
  - **Attackers Win:** City leader is killed before event ends
  - Only the winning faction receives rewards

- **Automatic Rewards:**  
  Winning faction players within the configured radius receive:
  - Honor points (configurable, default 100)
  - Gold scaled by level: Base amount (default 50 silver at level 1) + additional gold per level (default 50 silver per level)
    * Example: Level 80 player receives 50 silver + (50 silver Ã— 80) = 40.5 gold
  - Confirmation message (configurable)
  
- **Faction-Specific Rewards:**
  - Alliance cities (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar):
    * Alliance players rewarded if leader survives
    * Horde players rewarded if leader is killed
  - Horde cities (Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon):
    * Horde players rewarded if leader survives
    * Alliance players rewarded if leader is killed

Customization
-------------
### Adding Custom Creatures

To use custom creatures for siege events:

1. Create or select creature entries in your database.
2. Update the `mod_city_siege.conf` file with your custom creature entry IDs.
3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

### Customizing Messages and Yells

All announcement messages and creature yells are configurable in `mod_city_siege.conf`:

1. **Announcement Messages:**  
   Edit `CitySiege.Message.SiegeStart`, `CitySiege.Message.SiegeEnd`, and `CitySiege.Message.Reward` to customize text. Use `%s` as a placeholder for the city name.

2. **Creature Yells:**  
   - `CitySiege.Yell.LeaderSpawn`: Message leaders yell when they spawn
   - `CitySiege.Yell.Combat`: Semicolon-separated list of random combat yells. Leaders and mini-bosses will randomly select one message to yell every 30 seconds (configurable via `CitySiege.YellFrequency`).

3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

Example custom combat yells:
```
CitySiege.Yell.Combat = "We will crush you!;Bow before us!;Your end is near!;Resistance is futile!"
```

### Adjusting Spawn Locations

Spawn coordinates for each city are fully configurable in `mod_city_siege.conf`:

1. Use `.gps` command in-game to get coordinates outside city gates.
2. Update `CitySiege.CITYNAME.SpawnX/Y/Z` in your config file.
3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

Example for Stormwind:
```
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnX = -8500.0
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnY = 600.0
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnZ = 95.0
```

Enemies will spawn in a 30-yard radius circular formation around this point.

Debugging
---------
To enable detailed debug logging, update the configuration file:

    CitySiege.DebugMode = 1

This will output comprehensive information about:
- Configuration loading
- Event scheduling
- Creature spawning
- AI state changes
- Reward distribution

Troubleshooting
---------------
> **Events are not starting.**  
> Ensure that `CitySiege.Enabled = 1` and at least one city is enabled in the configuration file. Check server logs for any errors.

> **No announcements appearing.**  
> Verify `CitySiege.AnnounceRadius` is set correctly. If using a radius value, ensure players are within range of the city center. Set to 0 for world-wide announcements.

> **Configuration changes not taking effect.**  
> Confirm the config file is in the correct location (`/path/to/server/etc/modules/mod_city_siege.conf`), check file permissions, and restart the worldserver after making changes.

> **Creatures not spawning.**  
> Enable debug mode and check logs for spawning errors. Verify that the configured creature entries exist in your database.

> **Rewards not being distributed.**  
> Ensure `CitySiege.RewardOnDefense = 1` and that players meet the minimum level requirement. Players must be within the announcement radius of the city center when the event ends successfully.
