# AzerothCore Module: City Siege

## Overview

The **City Siege** module adds dynamic, timed siege events to all major cities in World of Warcraft. On a random, configurable timer, opposing faction forces will assault a major city, spawning enemy units outside the city limits who march toward the city leader while engaging defenders.

Enemy forces spawn at the city outskirts (150 yards from center) and use AI pathfinding to march into the city, attacking the faction leader as their primary objective. Defenders must protect their city leaders or face defeat. Successful defense is rewarded with honor and gold.

This module creates exciting world events that encourage player participation in defending their cities and creates a more dynamic, living world experience.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Module

Navigate to your AzerothCore modules directory and clone this repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mod-city-siege.git
```

### 2. Recompile AzerothCore

Rebuild the server with the new module:

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/server
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```

### 3. Configure the Module

Copy the configuration file to your server's config directory:

```bash
cp /path/to/azerothcore/modules/mod-city-siege/conf/mod_city_siege.conf.dist /path/to/server/etc/modules/mod_city_siege.conf
```

Edit the configuration file to customize the module behavior:

```bash
nano /path/to/server/etc/modules/mod_city_siege.conf

## How It Works

### Event Flow

1. **Timer**: The module waits for a random interval between `TimerMin` and `TimerMax`
2. **City Selection**: A random enabled city is selected for siege
3. **Announcement**: Players in range (or server-wide) are notified: *"|cffff0000[City Siege]|r The city of X is under attack! Defenders are needed!"*
4. **Spawn Phase**: Enemy forces spawn **outside the city** (150 yards from center) in circular formation
5. **Cinematic Phase**: For the configured delay (default 45s), enemies remain passive and engage in roleplay yells
6. **Combat Phase**: After the cinematic, enemies become aggressive and use AI pathfinding to march toward the city leader
7. **Event Duration**: The siege lasts for the configured duration (default 30 minutes)
8. **Victory Check**: System verifies if the city leader survived using FindNearestCreature()
9. **Resolution**: Event ends, creatures despawn, rewards are distributed to nearby defenders (if leader survived)

### Event Mechanics

- **Strategic Spawning**: Enemies spawn in stages from outside to inside:
  - Minions: 150 yards from city center (outermost ring)
  - Elites: 135 yards (90% radius)
  - Mini-bosses: 120 yards (80% radius)
  - Leaders: 105 yards (70% radius, leading the charge)
- **AI Pathfinding**: All creatures use `GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint()` to navigate toward the city leader
- **Target Priority**: Siege forces prioritize the city leader but will attack players and NPCs in their path
- **Periodic Yells**: Leaders and mini-bosses yell threatening messages every 30 seconds:
  - "Your defenses crumble!"
  - "This city will burn!"
  - "Face your doom!"
  - "None can stand against us!"
  - "Your leaders will fall!"
- **Player Defense**: Players can engage the invaders to protect their city
- **Automatic Rewards**: Successful defenders within range receive:
  - Honor points (configurable, default 100)
  - Gold (configurable, default 50g)
  - Confirmation message: *"|cff00ff00[City Siege]|r You have been rewarded for defending X!"*

## Customization

### Adding Custom Creatures

To use custom creatures for siege events, you'll need to:

1. Create or select creature entries in your database
2. Modify the `SpawnSiegeCreatures()` function in `mod-city-siege.cpp`
3. Define spawn locations for each city
4. Configure creature AI for attacking behavior

### Creating Custom Yells

Siege leaders can be configured to yell custom messages. This requires:

1. Adding creature text entries to your database
2. Implementing yell logic in the update loop
3. Linking yells to specific creature entries

### Adjusting Spawn Locations

Spawn coordinates for each city are defined in the `CityData` structure. You can:

1. Modify the center coordinates in `g_Cities` vector
2. Add multiple spawn points per city
3. Create different spawn patterns for different enemy types

### Customization Options

The module is ready to use out-of-the-box with default creature entries, but can be customized:

**Custom Creature Entries**: Edit `mod_city_siege.conf` to use different creatures:
```
CitySiege.Creature.Alliance.Minion = YOUR_ENTRY_ID
CitySiege.Creature.Horde.Leader = YOUR_ENTRY_ID
```

**Custom Spawn Locations**: Modify the `g_Cities` vector in `mod-city-siege.cpp` to adjust center coordinates.

**Custom Yells**: Edit the `yells` vector in `UpdateSiegeEvents()` function to add your own messages.

**Spawn Formation**: Adjust `spawnRadius` variable in `SpawnSiegeCreatures()` to change distance from city center (default: 150 yards).

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Starting

- Check if module is enabled: `CitySiege.Enabled = 1`
- Verify at least one city is enabled
- Check server logs for errors
- Enable debug mode for detailed information

### No Announcements

- Verify `CitySiege.AnnounceRadius` is set correctly
- Check if players are in range (if radius is not 0)
- Ensure players are on the correct map

### Configuration Not Loading

- Verify config file is in the correct location
- Check file permissions
- Restart worldserver after configuration changes
- Enable debug mode to see loaded values
